## What are my interests?
### Computers & Programming:
#### I have been keen about Computers for a long time, computers have been a part of my life since I can remember. Programming was first introduced to me when I was 8 but I finally started to take coding seriously around the first COVID wave in India (March/April 2020)
### Books:
#### I have a ton of books which I regularly read.Some of my favourite books are: 
#### The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, The strange case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde,Alex's Adventure in Numberland. Books are the reason why I am able to communicate to you.
### Stamps:
#### I love collecting stamps, I have collected some and I have borrowed some. My favourite one is a stamp from the US.

### Badminton:
#### I do know a bit of badminton but dont expect too much, I havent played a single match in over a year due to covid, I might start playing it once this virus ends.


### Thats pretty much about me! Thanks for reading :)

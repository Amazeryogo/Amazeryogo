## Interests?
### 1) Computers & Programming:

### 2) Books:
#### I have a ton of books which I regularly read.Some of my favourite books are: 
#### The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, 
#### The strange case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde,
#### Alex's Adventure in Numberland. 
#### Books are the reason why I am able to communicate to you.
### 3) Stamps:
#### I love collecting stamps, I have collected some and I have borrowed some. My favourite one is a stamp from the US.
###  4) Badminton:
#### I do know a bit of badminton but dont expect too much, I havent played a single match in over a year due to covid, I might start playing it once this virus ends.
